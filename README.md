## üéØ What is **CTRL - Boost**?

**CTRL - Boost** is a powerful, PowerShell-based performance enhancer designed to:

- üöÄ Maximize your FPS  
- ‚ö° Reduce input and network latency  
- üßπ Clean and optimize RAM usage  
- üîß Apply system-level tweaks seamlessly  

All with **one click**, boosting your PC‚Äôs gaming and general performance effortlessly!

---

## üìÇ Package Contents

- `CTRLBoost.ps1` ‚Äî The core PowerShell script that applies all the tweaks and launches your target apps.  
- `RunCTRLBoost.bat` ‚Äî A batch file that runs the PowerShell script **with Administrator privileges** and proper execution policy.

---

## üöÄ How to Use CTRL - Boost

1. **Keep both `CTRLBoost.ps1` and `RunCTRLBoost.bat` in the same folder!**  
   Moving one file without the other will break the setup.

2. **Double-click `RunCTRLBoost.bat`.**  
   This launcher:
   - Automatically runs the PowerShell script **as Administrator**.  
   - Shows a console window with progress updates.  
   - Keeps the window open after completion until you press any key.

3. **Make sure to run with Administrator rights.**  
   The script needs elevated permissions to apply system tweaks successfully.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why This Setup?

- PowerShell scripts (`.ps1`) **cannot be double-clicked directly** due to Windows security restrictions.  
- The `.bat` file **automatically elevates privileges** and bypasses execution policy restrictions safely.  
- Works **on any Windows version and folder location** without manual configuration.  
- Portable and user-friendly ‚Äî just keep both files together!

---

## üìå Additional Tips

- Feel free to **move the entire folder anywhere** on your PC.  
- For quick access, create a shortcut to `RunCTRLBoost.bat` on your Desktop or Start Menu.  
- Always launch via the batch file to avoid permission or policy issues.
